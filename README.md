# Zomato-analysis

This project focused on understanding the ETL pipeline and foundational spatial analysis techniques using Python. Here, I explored how to read, manipulate, and process spatial data with libraries such as Pandas, Folium, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. A major component of the course involved creating spatial visualizations—including choropleth maps, geographical scatter plots, heatmaps, and marker-based maps—to effectively communicate spatial insights.
